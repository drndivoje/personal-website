        <p><h1>I made a static code generator</h1>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, a static site generator written in Rust, to build my personal website from markdown files. My goal was to create a minimalist website with just a landing page and my blog posts. I wanted to avoid using JavaScript and keep everything as simple as possible.</p>

<p>However, Zola—like other popular static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo—is designed for general use and comes with many features that add unnecessary complexity for a basic website. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting why my blog posts weren’t displaying, searching for a suitable theme, and figuring out how to implement tagging (I now use taxonomies, but it took some time to figure out).</p>

<p>Eventually, I realized that building my own static site generator, tailored specifically to my needs, would be a better investment of time than tweaking an existing general-purpose solution.
So, I created <a href="https://github.com/drndivoje/PersonalPageGen">PersonalPageGen</a> lightweight static site generator designed for minimalist personal websites.</p>

<p>Initially, I built it to fit my own needs, but I plan to refine it further so others can use it.</p>
