        <p><h1>The First Post</h1>

<p>For my my first post on this blog I will keep it as short and simple as possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Ivan, a Software Developer embarking on a new journey of sharing my thoughts and experiences through this blog. Here, I aim to delve into various aspects of my life, including my work in software development and my passions such as bicycles, nature, animals, and anything else that catches my interest.

 The idea of having a personal website has been on my mind for almost a decade now. Although I made an attempt in the past (<a href="https://drndivoje.wordpress.com/">see here</a>.), I eventually gave up after two years of content creation. I attempted to realise this idea but I gave up after 2 years of producing content. Now, with drnd.rocks, I&rsquo;m giving it another shot, hoping to create a platform that truly reflects my thoughts on different topics.</p>

<p>To build this site, I&rsquo;ve opted for a static approach using the Zola framework, which is similar to Jekyll but written in Rust. While I primarily focus on backend development, evaluating frontend frameworks is relatively new to me. However, I&rsquo;ve found that in many cases, they offer similar functionality with different names. I&rsquo;m excited to embark on this journey and share my insights with you all. Stay tuned for more updates and reflections!</p>
